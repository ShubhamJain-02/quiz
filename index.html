    type: "true/false",
    question: "Is tokenization the process of splitting text into meaningful units such as words or sentences?",
    answer: "True",
    insight: "Tokenization is a fundamental step in NLP that breaks text into words, phrases, or sentences."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Are stopwords the most important words in a sentence and should always be retained for NLP tasks?",
    answer: "False",
    insight: "Stopwords are common words (e.g., 'is,' 'the,' 'and') that are often removed to reduce noise in text analysis."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Does lemmatization reduce words to their root form by considering the meaning and grammatical structure?",
    answer: "True",
    insight: "Lemmatization uses linguistic rules to convert words to their base forms (e.g., 'running' → 'run')."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Is Named Entity Recognition (NER) used to identify and classify proper nouns in text, such as people, locations, and organizations?",
    answer: "True",
    insight: "NER extracts entities like names, dates, and locations from text, which is useful for structured information extraction."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Does TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) assign higher weights to words that appear frequently in all documents?",
    answer: "False",
    insight: "TF-IDF assigns higher weights to words that appear frequently in a single document but are rare across the entire corpus."
  },
  {
    type: "multiple",
    question: "Which of the following is NOT an NLP preprocessing technique?",
    options: ["Tokenization", "Stemming", "Normalization", "Random Forest"],
    answer: "Random Forest",
    insight: "Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm, whereas the other options are common NLP preprocessing techniques."

      "Convert words to their base forms",
      "Assign grammatical categories to words",
      "Remove unnecessary words",
      "Translate text into another language"

    answer: "Assign grammatical categories to words",
    insight: "POS tagging labels words based on their role in a sentence, such as noun, verb, or adjective."
  },
  {
    type: "multiple",
    question: "Which NLP technique is used to determine if a text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment?",
    options: ["Stemming", "Sentiment Analysis", "Dependency Parsing", "Speech Recognition"],
    answer: "Sentiment Analysis",
    insight: "Sentiment analysis helps understand the emotional tone of text, often used in social media monitoring and reviews."

    insight: "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful NLP model developed by Google for contextual understanding."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Does word embedding represent words as high-dimensional vectors to capture their meaning?",
    answer: "True",
    insight: "Word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe transform words into dense vector representations, preserving semantic relationships."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Does stemming always produce valid English words?",
    answer: "False",
    insight: "Stemming removes suffixes based on simple rules, which can lead to non-standard words (e.g., 'running' → 'run' but 'studies' → 'studi')."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Can word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words?",
    answer: "True",
    insight: "Word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe map words into vector space where similar words are close together."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Does Bag of Words (BoW) consider the order of words in a document?",
    answer: "False",

    question: "Which of the following techniques helps reduce the dimensionality of text data?",
    options: ["TF-IDF", "One-Hot Encoding", "Word2Vec", "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)"],
    answer: "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
    insight: "PCA is a technique used to reduce dimensions in feature space, including text representations."

    question: "Which of the following NLP models is known for its attention mechanism?",
    options: ["LSTM", "GRU", "Transformer", "Naive Bayes"],
    answer: "Transformer",
    insight: "Transformers use self-attention to capture dependencies across long sequences, improving NLP performance."
  },
  {
    type: "true/false",
    question: "Does transfer learning allow pre-trained language models to be fine-tuned for new NLP tasks?",
    answer: "True",
    insight: "Transfer learning enables models like BERT and GPT to adapt to new NLP tasks by fine-tuning on domain-specific data."
  },
  {
    type: "multiple",
    question: "Which of the following are applications of Named Entity Recognition (NER)?",
    options: ["Extracting company names from news articles", "Identifying product names in reviews", "Finding dates in historical texts", "All of the above"],
